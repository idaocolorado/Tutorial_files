Patient was seen in follow-up today for well patient visit.  There are no acute
complaints at this time.  She is feeling well, and tolerating the current
medications.  She has started a new exercise regimen that consists of biking
30 minutes each day up the hill behind her house.  She has not noticed any
limitations with this activity.  She notes that her diet has been not great,
probably too many fatty foods, but otherwise she is trying to eat more solid
and less carbohydrates.

Physical exam:
General: NAD
HEENT: Within normal limits
Lungs: Normal breath sounds, with no rales, crackles, or wheezes
Heart: Regular rhythm, normal rate.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops
GI: Soft, nontender, nondistended
Extremities: Within normal limits


Labs:
HDL: 43
LDL: 141
TC: 221
TG: 397
HgbA1c: 7.1%

Assessment/plan:
Although she is doing well clinically, her labs are less than ideal.  After a
shared decision-making discussion, we have decided to trial rosuvastatin today.
We will plan to repeat labs in 1 month, and follow-up in 3 to 6 months,
depending on how she tolerates the medication.  I have also placed a referral
to endocrinology for probable diabetes and continued work-up.
