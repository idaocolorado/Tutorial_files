Assessment/plan:
Since we are unable to obtain prior records, but given her family history of
early coronary artery disease, we will plan to manage her risk factors
aggressively.  I ordered labs for cholesterol and baseline CBC and Chemistry.
Will plan to see her back in a few months to discuss diet and exercise as
indicated.  She sees her OB/Gyn for routine pap smears/vaginal exams, and this
provider also manages mammography.
