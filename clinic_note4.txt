Patient seen in urgent care for persistent headaches.  Has tried motrin without
success.  No vision changes, or associated neurological symptoms.

Physical exam:
General: NAD
HEENT: Within normal limits
Lungs: Normal breath sounds, with no rales, crackles, or wheezes
Heart: Regular rhythm, normal rate.  No murmurs, rubs, or gallops
GI: Soft, nontender, nondistended
Extremities: Within normal limits
Neuro: EOMI, PERRL, no focal weakness, sensory, or vibratory deficits.  No
red desaturation.


Assessment/plan:
Suspect this is a stronger version of her usual tension headaches.  We discussed
the different options for pain management, including opiates, although she is
reluctant due to concerns about addiction/dependence.  Notified that if she
develops fevers, neurological signs, or worsening, she should return for
additional evaluation, here or at the ED.
