Brief note: The patient was seen today as an add-on due to a finding from a
brain MRI that was performed in the ED last week for evaluation of ongoing
headaches, not responding to motrin.  Headaches have resolved, but her MRI
showed evidence of a possible aneurysm, 7x8 mm in posterior circulation (report)
unavailable.  No other neurological symptoms.

We discussed that these findings are often something that is monitored over
time, but given her level of anxiety, will plan to refer her to neurology for
additional evaluation.
